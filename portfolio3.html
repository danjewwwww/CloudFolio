            A number system is a mathematical framework for representing numbers and performing operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Common number systems include the decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems, each with unique characteristics. The decimal number system, with a base of 10, uses digits 0-9, where each digit's place value increases by powers of 10. The binary system, essential for computers, has a base of 2 and uses only 0 and 1 to represent "on" and "off" states. The octal system, with a base of 8, uses digits 0-7 and is often applied in computing contexts. The hexadecimal system, with a base of 16, incorporates digits 0-9 and letters A-F to represent values 10-15, making it a key component in programming and digital technology.
