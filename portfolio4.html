            A computer system includes a CPU, memory, input and output devices, and an operating system, working together with hardware components like input, processing, storage, and communication devices. A computer processes, stores, and retrieves data, executing tasks through hardware and software. Types of computers include supercomputers, mainframes, servers, workstations, mini computers, and microcomputers, each designed for specific functions. Data flows through the system via input, processing by the CPU, storage, and output. Software, including application and system software, manages these tasks. Programming languages enable software creation, with types like procedural, functional, object-oriented, and logic programming. Hardware and software impact various sectorsâ€”enhancing education, healthcare, government services, and business operations.
